Using this package you can add a beautiful date or datetime picker into your project without touching any javascript with the power or laravel component. It is just a laravel component wrapper for the [Flatpickr](https://flatpickr.js.org/) javascript library.

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require asdh/laravel-flatpickr
```

You can publish the config file with:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="flatpickr-config"
```

You can publish the assets with:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="flatpickr-assets"
```

This is the contents of the published config file:

```php
return [
    /**
     * The url to be used to serve css file.
     * If null, it will use the one shipped with package.
     */
    'css_url' => env('FLATPICKR_CSS_URL', null),

    /**
     * The url to be used to serve js file.
     * If null, it will use the one shipped with package.
     */
    'js_url' => env('FLATPICKR_JS_URL', null),

    /**
     * Determines if the styles shipped with the package should be used.
     * Setting it to false will remove the styling for the component.
     * The flatpickr css will be untouched.
     */
    'use_style' => env('FLATPICKR_USE_STYLE', true),
];
```

## Usage

You need to include the css and js that ships with the package in your html or blade file.

### Adding Css

Include this style at the head section of your page:

```php
@include('flatpickr::components.style')
```

Or you can use laravel blade component syntax:

```html
<x-flatpickr::style />
```

If you want to use different `url` for the css then you can change it from the .env file:

```env
FLATPICKR_CSS_URL=https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/flatpickr/4.6.9/flatpickr.min.css
```

You can even change the `url` from the component itself:

```html
<x-flatpickr::style
    url="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/flatpickr/4.6.9/flatpickr.min.css"
/>
```

The `url` passed form the component will take more priority over the config file.

### Adding Js

Similarly include this script at the bottom of your page:

```php
@include('flatpickr::components.script')
```

Or you can use laravel blade component syntax:

```html
<x-flatpickr::script />
```

If you want to use different `url` for the js then you can change it from the .env file:

```env
FLATPICKR_JS_URL=https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/flatpickr/4.6.9/flatpickr.min.js
```

You can even change the `url` from the component itself:

```html
<x-flatpickr::script
    url="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/flatpickr/4.6.9/flatpickr.min.js"
/>
```

The `url` passed form the component will take more priority over the config file.

### Using the component

Add it to your page.

```html
<x-flatpickr />
```

Yes, it's that simple. Now you have a beautiful looking date picker in your page without touching a single javascript at all.

## Component props

I have made different `props` for this component that will be converted into the `config` options of the `flatpickr`. Make sure to look into the [config options](https://flatpickr.js.org/options) of the flatpickr.

Most of the description of the props written here are taken from the flatpickr documentation page.

### id

**Type:** string

Set the id of the component. It will apply id to the underlying `input` tag. If no id is provided, it will use the autogenerated id.

**Example:**

```html
<x-flatpickr id="laravel-flatpickr" />
```

### dateFormat

**Type:** string

A string of characters which are used to define how the date will be displayed in the input box. Please check the [flatpickr documentation](https://flatpickr.js.org/formatting/) page for the supported characters. By default the date format is `Y-m-d` but you can change it to other formats to like `d/m/Y`.

**Example:**

```html
<x-flatpickr date-format="d/m/Y" />
```

### altFormat

**Type:** string

Exactly the same as date format, but for the altInput field. If you want different format to be visible for the user then you can use this. By default it will use the same format as that of `dateFormat`.

**Example:**

```html
<x-flatpickr alt-format="F j, Y" />
```

### minDate

**Type:** string|Carbon

The minimum date that a user can start picking from.

You can pass a `Carbon` instance or a date format in `string` that is supported by `Carbon` or `DateTime`.

**Example:**

```html
<x-flatpickr min-date="2022-02-13" />

OR

<x-flatpickr :min-date="today()" />

OR

<x-flatpickr :min-date="\Carbon\Carbon::parse('2022-02-13')" />
```

### maxDate

**Type:** string|Carbon

The maximum date that a user can pick to.

You can pass a `Carbon` instance or a date format in `string` that is supported by `Carbon` or `DateTime`.

**Example:**

```html
<x-flatpickr show-time time-format="h:i" />
```

When you use `show-time` prop with `alt-format`, make sure to write both date and time format in the `alt-format` like this:

**Example:**

```html
<x-flatpickr show-time time-format="h:i" alt-format="F j, Y, H:i" />
```
